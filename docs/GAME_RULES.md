## 🕹️ The Basics

1. **Roll:** Each turn, you roll a 6-sided die (D6).
2. **Place:** You must choose one of the **3 columns** to place your die.
3. **Score:** The value of the die is added to that column's score.

## 📊 Scoring System (Combos)

Strategy lies in stacking identical dice in the same column.
The scoring formula is **exponential**: `(Face Value × Count) × Count`.

Here is how the score scales up (using the number **6** as an example):

| Combo Type | Dice in Column | Math Logic | Total Points |
| :--- | :---: | :--- | :---: |
| **Single** | `[6]` | 6 x 1 | **6** |
| **Double (x4)** | `[6]` `[6]` | (6 + 6) x 2 | **24** |
| **Triple (x9)** | `[6]` `[6]` `[6]` | (6 + 6 + 6) x 3 | **54** |

> **Note:** Different numbers in the same column are simply added together.
> *Example:* A `[6]` and a `[5]` in the same column are worth **11 points** (6 + 5).

## ⚔️ The Twist: Destroying Dice

This is the most critical mechanic. If you place a die in a column that matches the value of your opponent's die **in that same column**:

**💥 The opponent's dice of that value are destroyed!**

They are removed from the board immediately, reducing their score. This allows for aggressive plays (clearing the enemy board) or defensive plays (preventing them from building combos).

> **💡 Pro Tip: The "Last-Second" Comeback**
>
> This rule applies even on the **very last move** of the game!
>
> If the move that fills your board (ending the game) also triggers a destruction, your opponent loses those points *before* the winner is decided. Saving a matching die for the final turn can be a game-winning surprise strategy.
